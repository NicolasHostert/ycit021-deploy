# YCIT021 - Deployment repo

## Objective

This repo is used to deploy the infrastructure and the application, all in one go

## Branches

Depending on which branch you are doing an update, it will push to either DEV or PROD, with its own sets of parameters.

The Github Actions will be maintained in Main, and updating updatetorun.txt with the current date will trigger the build.
