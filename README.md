# YCIT021 - Deployment repository

## Objective

This repository is used to deploy the infrastructure and the application, all in one go.

## How to deploy the application in the DEV and PROD environments?
To deploy the infrastructure, go to the [actions](https://github.com/NicolasHostert/ycit021-deploy/actions/workflows/main.yml), and click Run workflow.

It will deploy the DEV environment straight away.

It will wait for an approval from the repository owner for the PROD environment.


## How to access the applications?

You will get the URL of the application in the application job, in the "Check the deployed service URL" step.


## Workflow: Deploy all the things
### Pre-flight
In that step, we are checking that the Dockerfile and the Terraform code are properly linted. If this fails, it will prevent the rest of the workflow to be executed.

### dev-infra and prod-infra

* It will deploy the infrastructure
* It is based on the Moonwalkers terraform module
* It takes the proper credentials and configs from the project secrets

### dev-application and prod-application
* The application that will be deployed can be found [there](https://github.comNicolasHostert/nuxt-realworld).
* The image has been build and is deployed with a Helm chart that can be found [there](https://github.com/NicolasHostert/ycit021-myapp).
* After deploying the application, it will curl the appliction URL to determine if we get a 200 http response code or not, and fail if it's not working.
